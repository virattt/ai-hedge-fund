# AI Hedge Fund

This is a proof of concept for an AI-powered hedge fund. The goal of this project is to explore the use of AI to make trading decisions. This project is for **educational** purposes only and is not intended for real trading or investment.

## How to Install

```bash
pipx install aihf
```

(or `uv tool install aihf`, or `pip install aihf` into an environment of your choice)

Then run it from anywhere:

```bash
aihf
```

### API keys

The app asks for keys the first time it needs them and saves them to `~/.hedge-fund/.env` — nothing to configure up front. It needs:

- A [Financial Datasets](https://financialdatasets.ai) API key, for prices, fundamentals, and earnings.
- One model API key for the investor agents. Supported providers: Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Google, xAI, Kimi, TypeSafe (Jev).

Keys exported in your shell always win over the saved file.

## How to Run

### Interactive app

```bash
aihf
```

With no arguments, this launches the interactive terminal app. Build a fund — pick stocks, strategies, rebalance cadence — or backtest a saved fund and watch its equity curve draw against its benchmark. Funds you build are saved as mandate files in `~/.hedge-fund/mandates/`.

### Non-interactive

Run one fund cycle from a mandate file. The full cycle record prints to stdout as JSON; a short human summary goes to stderr:

```bash
aihf ~/.hedge-fund/mandates/example.yaml --tickers AAPL,MSFT
```

Run the same mandate with Jev after configuring `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`:

```bash
aihf ~/.hedge-fund/mandates/example.yaml --tickers AAPL,MSFT --model jev-1.13.0
```

Backtest the mandate over history at its rebalance cadence:

```bash
aihf ~/.hedge-fund/mandates/example.yaml --tickers AAPL,MSFT --backtest
```

An LLM trained after your backtest window may remember how those companies did, and that memory would score as skill. So a backtest withholds the ticker, industry and calendar dates from the investor agents' prompts; the personas see the fundamentals with periods labelled t-0, t-1, ... instead. This reduces the recall without removing it (distinctive numbers can still give a large company away), and a window after the model's training cutoff is the cleanest read. Live runs are unaffected and name the company.

A mandate is the desk — strategies, staff, risk, capital, cadence — and never names tickers; `--tickers` says what to point it at for this run.

## Development
